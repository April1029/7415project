      <p class="lead" style="margin-top: 3rem">Longquan celadon (龍泉青瓷) is a type of green-glazed Chinese ceramic, known
        in the West as celadon or greenware, produced from about 950 to 1550. The kilns were mostly located in Lishui
        prefecture in southwestern Zhejiang Province in the south of China, and the north of Fujian Province. Overall a
        total of some 500 kilns have been discovered, making the Longquan celadon production area one of the largest
        historical ceramic producing areas in China.Celadon production had a long history at Longquan and related sites,
        but it was not until the Northern Song (960–1127) period that large-scale production began, and the move of the
        capital to Hangzhou, close to Longquan, after the start of the Southern Song (1127–1279), was probably important
        in the great expansion of both quality and production there. Both continued at high levels in the Yuan
        (1271–1368) and the early part of the Ming (1368–1644) periods. Longquan celadons were an important part of
        China's export economy for over five hundred years, and were widely imitated in other countries, especially
        Korea and Japan. Their demise came after they were overtaken in their markets by blue and white porcelain from
        Jingdezhen.The techniques are now recognized as Intangible Heritage.</p>
