In addition to clay, the main component is glaze. Different types of glazed celadon use different kinds of soil. The typical Longquan celadon glaze comes from purple gold soil, now pure purple gold soil is very few, each celadon manufacturer has their different glaze blending methods, so the glaze color is not exactly the same, they are all unique and special, actually from the glaze, you can tell which manufacturer it is. Glaze blending is an ancestral secret recipe, outsiders do not know, but one thing for sure, they will never add pigments, glaze color is produced in the original flame.");
