            <p style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">Right hand is a mapping of the unique soil resources that contributes to Longquan celadon making, along with water, traffic situations which are quite important in both making process and selling or communicating process. Also, there are several important location with rich celadon making culture and history.
            Many traditional craftsmanship have always been faced with the embarrassment of art inheritance, or the traditional skills are out of touch, or the inheritance of skills is biased, which more or less causes the regret of traditional craftsmanship in our country. With no exception, Longquan celadon experienced the same situation.
            To better reflect the cultural value of Longquan celadon, we should not only innovate in inheritance, but also develop in innovation, which is the only way to the development of celadon. Innovation must be superior to the things it refers to, and if this is not achieved, innovation will lose its meaning. Innovation should be reflected in two aspects, one is ideological, the other is technical (artistic). The living space of modern people continues to expand, the thinking is diversified, the aesthetic ability and aesthetic taste are also constantly improved, and the taste of cultural works of art is required to be higher. The thoughts and emotions expressed in celadon works must be novel and unconventional. This requires artists to establish a correct creative concept, go deep into life, be good at observing new things, refine the theme of creation, and create good works with distinctive ideological nature loved by the public.
            The purpose of this website is to spread the words, let more people understand this unique culture, and also hoping that more people will be interested in inherating and innovating this traditional skill, we look forward to a better tomorrow about the modernization of Longquan celadon.
