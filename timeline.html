          <h2 class="timeline__content-title">Before Song Dynasty</h2>
          <p class="timeline__content-desc" style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">Celadon originated from Yue kiln in Han Dynasty.Longquan celadon is the post-rising star in the celadon. Longquan began to make celadon porcelain kilns in the Sanguo era. After several generations of development in Jin Dynasty and Sui and Tang dynasties, it stood out from the Song Dynasty, surpassing other celadon, and entered the heyday, before and after hundreds of years of glory.

          <h2 class="timeline__content-title">Northern Song Dynasty</h2>
          <p class="timeline__content-desc" style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">In the Northern Song period the Dayao (大窑) kiln site near Longquan city alone produced wares at twenty-three separate kilns; with Jincun nearby, these appear to have been the largest kiln complexes, and produced the best wares. The era of greatest ceramic production was not until the Southern Song (1127–1279), then continuing in the Yuan (1271–1368) and Ming (1368–1644) periods.</p>

          <h2 class="timeline__content-title">Sourthern Song Dynasty</h2>
          <p class="timeline__content-desc "style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">A key event in the rise of Longquan celadon was the flight of the remaining Northern Song court to the south, after they lost control of the north in the disastrous Jin-Song wars of the 1120s. A new Southern Song court was based in Hangzhou, close to Longquan. The Northern Celadon kilns declined as Longquan greatly expanded production.</p>

          <h2 class="timeline__content-title">Yuan Dynasty</h2>
          <p class="timeline__content-desc"style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">A story repeated in many sources from the Yuan onwards, with uncertain significance, tells of two brothers called Zhang, both Longquan potters, perhaps in the Southern Song, though this is unclear. The elder brother developed a very special type of ware; rightly or wrongly the later sources say this was distinguished by crackled glaze, and Ge ware (meaning "elder brother ware") is supposed to be this type. The younger brother also developed a fine style of pottery, which is often taken to be the best quality early Longquan ware.</p>

          <h2 class="timeline__content-title">Summary from Northern Song to Yuan Dynasty </h2>
          <p class="timeline__content-desc"style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">The Southern Song period saw the finest quality, and a great range of colours, as well as a great expansion of production. A count in 1988 by a Chinese archaeologist of the starts of new kilns gave 39 from the Northern Song, 61 from the Southern Song, and over 70 from the Yuan. The percentage figures for those still producing in the 20th century were 23%, <10% and <5%, indicating a bubble of over-production, which only the strongest kilns survived.</p>

          <h2 class="timeline__content-title">Ming Dynasty</h2>
          <p class="timeline__content-desc"style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">Longquan celadon enjoyed a final period of high achievement under the early Ming dynasty, when it was an official kiln operated by and for the court. The floral decorative designs were very similar to those in contemporary Jingdezhen blue and white and also court lacquerwork, suggesting that pattern books were supplied from the centre by court artists. Shapes included large flat dishes that were very difficult to fire. By around the mid-15th century the court ceased its orders, and the decline of the kilns resumed. By the late Ming few kilns survived, and they mostly produced utilitarian wares such as tiles and water pots, as the area continues to do.</p>

          <p class="timeline__content-desc"style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">To the Qing Dynasty, very few Longquan kiln left, the product matrix is rough, glazed green and yellowish. It's a extremely cold winter for the whole industry. However, in a variety of coincidences, this miracl official dragon kiln was just set aside in dust, not totally ruined. </p>

          <h2 class="timeline__content-title">1957</h2>
          <p class="timeline__content-desc"style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;"> After the founding of the People's Republic of China, Longquan celadon regained the countrywide attention. In 1957, Premier Zhou Enlai released an instruction to restore the production of celadon. Under the call , a large amount of man power was injected into it, in the spring of the second year, the first kiln for the restoration of Longquan celadon was ignited. After 50 years of recovery, Longquan celadon entered a new period of prosperity. Although the top of the Southern Song Dynasty is still far, there is a new breakthrough on the basis of inheritance and archaism.

          <p class="timeline__content-desc"style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">On 30 September 2009, the fourth meeting of the UNESCO considered and approved 76 projects included traditional firing technique of Longquan celadon in the list of representatives for the non-material cultural heritage of mankind.</p>

          <p class="timeline__content-desc"style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">Because the function of celadon utensils is gradually replaced by modern objects, there is not much social demand. At present, some skills of celadon production are gradually forgotten, coupled with the intervention of modern machinery, the traditional handmade porcelain technology is facing serious challenges, is on the verge of extinction, and needs to be saved and protected.</p>
